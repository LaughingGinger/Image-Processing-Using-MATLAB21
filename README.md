# Image-Processing-Using-MATLAB21
This project shows calculation of forest fire affected area using Image Processing done on MATLAB 21.
**This Project was made by Syed Mohd Sarim and Nivit Karki.

A big Chunk of forest area of the country is anually affected by forest fire leading to enormous imapact on our biodiversity and ecosystems. 
The specific objective of this project is to :
1) Study the forest fire vulnerability using time series data  (2004-2011) .
2) Study the vulnerability on forest types and its classes.

In MATLAB21 we used the Image Segmenter App for segmenting the satellite images of the forest fire affected areas.
From the binary image results obtained we can calculate the area in pixels /sqkm .

**Observation:- It was observed that every year total forest fire Vunerablity area including;
-Very Dense Forest
-Moderately Dense Forest
-Open Forest
all over India is around 12-15 % of the total geographical area .
